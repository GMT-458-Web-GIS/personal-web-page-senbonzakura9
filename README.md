# https://senbonzakura9.github.io/webpage/ this is my personal github pages link because i dont have authorization to use github pages in this repository.
I tried to keep all the images in an image folder but i couldnt upload folder in repository so i uploaded all the images directly as png or jpg and search (src) for it manually.
Now I have beginner level experience using GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
I have spend approximately 3-4 hours of ai assistance.
The site works well with google chrome but it can be problematic in brave browser.
